    During my time at NIT I learnt most of my key skills that have I have taken through my career such as teamwork and working to tight deadlines. I thouroughly enjoyed my time as university and learnt a lot about a healthy work life balance.

    I spent a lot of my free time as a member of the *Photography Club* and *Technobyte Computer Science Society* taking on roles such as *committee head*, *event manager*, and eventually *President* of the society.
