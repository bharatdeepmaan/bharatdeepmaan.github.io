    During my time at NIT Kurukshetra, I learnt most of the key interpersonal skills such as decision making in complex situations, empathy, public speaking, teamwork and leadership. I thouroughly enjoyed my time at the university and learnt a lot by participating in competitions, technical workshops, guest lectures but most by interacting and ideating with the college-mates in campus.

    I spent a lot of my time as a member of the *Photography Club* and *Technobyte Computer Science Society*. Later taking on leadership roles such as *Marketing Manager* in pre-final year and *President* of the society in final year.
