    The first-of-its-kind, TLF interweaves Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) with real-world application, leadership and mentorship. The curriculum has been designed by a Program Committee of academicians and cutting-edge AI and ML practitioners and researchers. 

    TLF is built on four intertwined threads: Data-X coursework (AI and ML, design and systems thinking), Real-world Projects (Challenge Lab and Capstone Project), Guest Sessions by domain experts, business leaders and entrepreneurs, and Leadership and Mentorship.
