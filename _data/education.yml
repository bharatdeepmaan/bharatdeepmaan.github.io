    During my time at NIT Kurukshetra, I learnt most of my key skills such as working as a team in the tight schedules towards a common goal . I thouroughly enjoyed my time as university and learnt a lot about a healthy work life balance.

    I spent a lot of my free time as a member of the *Technobye Computer Science Society* taking on roles such as *Marketing Manager* in pre-final and *President* in final year.
